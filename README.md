# Game Overview
"Sparkle Loves Coins" is a unique and dynamic snake-like game with a distinct gameplay mechanism. In this game, players control a sparkle that weaves through a randomly generated map, avoiding obstacles, collecting coins and items, and defending against monster attacks to achieve higher scores.
# Gameplay
# Map Generation:

At the beginning of each round, a random map is generated. The map includes ground, fixed walls, and destructible walls. These walls limit the movement of the sparkle, adding a layer of challenge.
# Sparkle Movement:

Players control the sparkle's direction of movement.
# Coins:

Coins are periodically refreshed in the blank areas of the map. When the sparkle eats a coin, the player's score increases.
# Item System:
Destructible Walls: These walls disappear after being destroyed by bombs or by sparkle, adding unpredictability to the environment.
Moving Bombs: When the sparkle touches a bomb, it removes obstacles within a 5x5 range, opening up more space for movement.
Temporary Invincibility Item: When touched, this item activates a few seconds of invincibility, during which some obstacles the sparkle touches will disappear, increasing the chance of survival.
Speed Down Item: When touched, the sparkle's movement speed decreases to 0.5 times.
Dizzy Item: When touched, sparkle will be stunned for a while.

# Enemy System:
An enemy that moves slowly but tracks in real time, and an enemy that only approaches the player at a high speed when they can see the player will appear on the field, making the game more difficult. 
The player can use bombs or become invincible to destroy them and gain points, but otherwise making contact with them will result in losing the game.

# Dynamic Environment:

As time progresses, the game randomly generates new items and obstacles, creating a unique experience for each round.
# Game Objective
The goal of the player is to achieve the highest possible score by collecting coins and items, setting a higher score record. The challenge lies in making quick decisions in a constantly changing environment and strategically using the items.
# Visuals Effects
The game adopts a simple yet vibrant visual style with rich colors, providing players with a pleasant experience.
Future expansions include introducing new items, different types of obstacles, a level system, an achievement system, and more, further enhancing the fun and challenge of the game.
